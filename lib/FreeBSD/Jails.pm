=head1 NAME

FreeBSD::Jails - Get the list of running Jails in a FreeBSD system

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $jails = FreeBSD::Jails::get_jails ; 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple module to query a FreeBSD system for the list of running jails. 
Unfortunately there isn't a good way to call the jail_get system call with pure Perl,
so a little piece of C code is required to make this possible. 

=head1 METHODS

=over 2

=item get_jails

Returns a reference to a hash whose keys are jail ids (i.e. integers) and values are 
the names of the jails.

=head1 SUPPORT

Please open a ticket at L<https://github.com/aduitsis/FreeBSD-Jails>. 

I am new to XS, so unforeseen bugs or a small memory leak may be
present in the module. Caveat emptor.
